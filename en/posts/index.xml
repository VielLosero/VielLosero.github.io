      <description>Github account After my previous post where I start with Hugo the creation of a web page with static content, now it&amp;rsquo;s time to host that page in github.
I will not go into how to create an account on github, you can follow the instructions to create the account from this link. Hosting on github
Once the github account has been created, the ssh key has been added for remote management and the repository has been created, we will create the submodule.</description>

      <description>Why Hugo I chose hugo after comparing the top static site gen and reading a couple of posts by jekyll vs hugo, everyone will have their preferences. This is the first SSG I use since for some I had to start, Hugo&amp;rsquo;s documentation is quite broad and easy to understand.
Hugo installation Installing Hugo will depend on the operating system we have. In Devian it is as easy as using apt.</description>
