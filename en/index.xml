      <description>Creation of public and private keys To create the GPG keys we can use **gpg &amp;ndash;generate-key ** or **gpg &amp;ndash;full-generate-key ** the first command will create the keys without asking other options than necessary. If we want more control over some options such as size or validity period we will use **gpg &amp;ndash;full-generate-key **.
The size of the key is related to its security but also to the performance since it has to process with larger numbers.</description>

      <description>Script Code This script has helped me to generate mi website at initial moment since for me it was a bit awkward to editing all the files one by one to tests and see results of Hugo&amp;rsquo;s configuration . With this script we have all the initial configuration in a single file to be able to make configuration tests with Hugo relatively easy.
hugo-script-create-basic-site.sh
Testing the script Download root@kali:~# wget https://raw.</description>

      <description>Github account After my previous post where I start with Hugo the creation of a web page with static content, now it&amp;rsquo;s time to host that page in github.
I will not go into how to create an account on github, you can follow the instructions to create the account from this link. Hosting on github
Once the github account has been created, the ssh key has been added for remote management and the repository has been created, we will create the submodule.</description>

      <title>Hugo Static site generator: Starting with Hugo.</title>

      <description>Why Hugo I chose hugo after comparing the top static site gen and reading a couple of posts by jekyll vs hugo, everyone will have their preferences. This is the first SSG I use since for some I had to start, Hugo&amp;rsquo;s documentation is quite broad and easy to understand.
Hugo installation Installing Hugo will depend on the operating system we have. In Devian it is as easy as using apt.</description>
